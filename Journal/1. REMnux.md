# üß™ REMnux Installation Journey

## üìñ What is REMnux?
Following  some information justifying my interest on this distro.

**REMnux** is a Linux distribution designed for **malware analysis, reverse engineering, and digital forensics**.  
It comes preloaded with hundreds of open-source tools to examine suspicious files, network traffic, memory dumps, and more.

Developed by **Lenny Zeltser**, REMnux is based on **Ubuntu LTS**, and can be installed as:
- A standalone system (bare metal or virtual machine)
- A Docker container environment (`remnux/docker`)
- An add-on toolkit installed over an existing Ubuntu installation

---

## üß† Why Use REMnux?

REMnux provides an **all-in-one forensic lab** for:
- Analyzing **malware samples** (static & dynamic)
- Unpacking and inspecting **PE files**, **scripts**, and **documents**
- Deobfuscating **JavaScript**, **PowerShell**, and **VBA macros**
- Capturing and replaying **network traffic**
- Extracting indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- Automating analysis workflows

It‚Äôs widely used by **incident response teams**, **reverse engineers**, and **CTF players** to dissect malware behavior safely in an isolated environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Minimum System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 2 cores | 4+ cores |
| **RAM** | 4 GB | 8‚Äì16 GB |
| **Storage** | 60 GB | 100+ GB SSD |
| **OS Base** | Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 LTS | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| **Virtualization** | VMware / VirtualBox / Proxmox | Proxmox or VMware Workstation |
| **Network** | NAT or Host-Only | Host-Only for isolation |

> üí° Tip: If using Proxmox, allocate **at least 8 GB RAM** and **2 vCPUs** for comfortable operation when running tools like IDA Free, Ghidra, or Wireshark simultaneously.

# üß© Installing REMnux over Ubuntu (Mini ISO Edition)

## üìñ Overview

This guide walks through installing **REMnux** over a lightweight **Ubuntu Mini ISO** base system.  This is the refined guide, after several hours of trial and error.
It‚Äôs perfect for malware analysis labs, CTF environments, or air-gapped research VMs where minimal footprint and control are required.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1 ‚Äî Download and Install Ubuntu Mini ISO

1. Download the **Ubuntu Mini ISO** for your architecture:
   - [Ubuntu 20.04 Mini ISO (Netboot)](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD)
   - or [Ubuntu 22.04 Netboot Image](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot/)

2. Create a VM (Proxmox, VirtualBox, VMware, etc.) with at least:
   | Setting | Value |
   |----------|--------|
   | vCPUs | 2 (minimum) |
   | Memory | 4 GB (min) / 8 GB recommended |
   | Disk | 60 GB (min) / 100 GB+ SSD recommended |
   | Network | NAT or Host-only |

3. Boot from the Mini ISO and select **Install Ubuntu**.  
   When prompted:
   - Choose only **Standard System Utilities** (no GUI)
   - Skip additional packages like ‚ÄúOpenSSH‚Äù if you prefer to install later
   - Reboot into your new minimal system

---

## üîß Step 2 ‚Äî Prepare Ubuntu for REMnux

Log in and update the base system:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y curl gnupg lsb-release ca-certificates
sudo reboot
```
## üß∞ Step 3 ‚Äî Install the REMnux CLI Tool

The **REMnux CLI** (`remnux`) is the command-line utility used to install, update, and manage all REMnux components on top of your Ubuntu base system.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the Installer

Use `curl` to fetch the official installer script:
```bash
curl -O https://REMnux.org/remnux-cli
```

If `curl` is not installed yet, install it first:
```bash
sudo apt install -y curl
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Move It to `/usr/local/bin`

Move the downloaded script into a directory that‚Äôs included in your `$PATH`, and make it executable:
```bash
sudo mv remnux-cli /usr/local/bin/remnux
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/remnux
```

This allows you to run `remnux` from anywhere in the terminal without specifying the path.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Installation

Check that the REMnux CLI is correctly installed and available system-wide:
```bash
remnux --help
```

Expected output:
```
Usage: remnux [command]

Commands:
  install    Install or repair REMnux components
  upgrade    Update installed tools
  check      Verify installation status
  remove     Uninstall REMnux packages
```

If you see this output, the REMnux CLI is ready to use.

---

### üí° Tips

- The REMnux CLI manages all toolkit operations (install, update, verify, remove).  
- You‚Äôll use it in the next step to install the full REMnux environment:
  ```bash
  sudo remnux install
  ```
- Installation typically takes **30‚Äì90 minutes** depending on hardware and network speed.

---

‚úÖ **You‚Äôve successfully installed the REMnux CLI!** - Victory so far. 
Proceed to **Step 4 ‚Äî Install REMnux Packages** to set up the complete analysis toolkit.

---

## üß© Step 4 ‚Äî Install REMnux Packages

Run the REMnux installation command:
```bash
sudo remnux install
```

This will:
- Add the official REMnux APT repository  
- Download and install the full analysis toolkit (Ghidra, YARA, Volatility, Wireshark, etc.)  
- Configure Python environments and helper utilities  
- Adjust environment variables and system paths  

‚è≥ **Installation time:** 30‚Äì90 minutes depending on your hardware and network speed.

After installation, verify:
```bash
remnux check
```

If you see no errors, your REMnux environment is ready for use.

---

### üßπ Post-Installation Maintenance

Clean unused packages and cached files:
```bash
sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo apt clean
```

(Optional) enable SSH for remote access:
```bash
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
```

If you‚Äôre using virtualization (Proxmox, VMware, VirtualBox), **create a snapshot** now‚Äîthis will serve as your clean baseline before analyzing any samples.

---

### üîí Security Recommendations

- Always run REMnux in a **virtualized, isolated environment**.  
  Prefer **Host-only** or **Internal Network** adapters.
- **Disable clipboard sharing and drag-and-drop** with the host.
- **Never** open malware samples on your host or connected drives.
- Revert to the clean snapshot after each malware analysis session.

---

### üßæ Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `remnux install` | Install or repair all REMnux components |
| `remnux upgrade` | Update all installed tools |
| `remnux check` | Verify integrity and configuration |
| `remnux remove` | Uninstall REMnux packages |
